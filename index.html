  <h1><u> What Are Plants </u></h1>
  <p><i><b>Most plants have several things in common. They need sunshine, water, and air to grow. They are not able to move around. Their cells have stiff walls made of a tough material called cellulose. All green plants use the Sunâ€™s energy, water, and a gas called carbon dioxide to make their own food. This process is called photosynthesis. <u>Did you know?</u> Some of the types of the bamboo plant can grow one meter in a single day. <u>Did you know?</u> Plants give off oxygen and consume carbon dioxide in a process known as photosynthesis.</i></b></p>
